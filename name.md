# Is Literal Name

The name of the function has not been decided, the candidates suggested so far include:

---

## `is_literal()`

- It's shorter than `is_from_literal()` (I'm a slow typer).
- Matches the current convention of existing "is_*" functions (all use a single word suffix).

---

## `is_from_literal()`

- Avoid cognitive dissonance with is_literal(), possibly confusing for developers who know what a literal is.

---

## `is_lstring()`

- Assuming there's a new literal type, it might be called `lstring`.
